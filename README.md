# Marlin 3D Printer Firmware customized for Artillery Sidewinder X1

This project forked from [Marlin](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin) to maintain my customizatio for [Artillery Sidewinder X1](https://artillery3d.com/artillery-sidewinder-x1-sw-x1-3d-printer-300x300x400mm-large-plus-size-high-precision-dual-z-axis-tft-touch-screen-p0013.html). 

## Building 
To this firmware is based on Marlin 2 and you will need Arduino IDE 1.8.8 or newer or PlatformIO. Detailed instructions on [Building Marlin with Arduino](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_arduino.html) and [Building Marlin with PlatformIO](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_rearm.html) can be used to build this firmware.
